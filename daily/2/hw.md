Homework 2
============

1.  Read chapters 4 and 5. Write a summary of the most important point
of each chapter.

2.  Prepare a glossary of at least 10 words, concepts, or ideas.

3.  Do the following Chapter 3 exercises (3.1, 3.3, 3.5, ..., 3.17,
3.19; 3.35, 3.37, 3.53, 3.61, 3.63, 3.69, 3.71), as well as the
following problems from Chapter 4: (4.3, 4.9, 4.11, 4.19, 4.21, 4.39,
4.41, 4.43, 4.47, 4.53)

These problems will NOT be graded for correctness (the answers are in
the back of the book anyway), but they will be checked for
completion. You should feel free to work with other classmates, but DO
NOT split up the work -- every student should be able to do every
problem on their own, and the quiz we will take at the beginning of
Day 3 will presume that you are personally prepared to do any of these
problems by yourself.  Bring these problems in on paper to Day 3.
