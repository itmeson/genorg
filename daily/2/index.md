Overview
=========

1.  Check written homework from the book
2.  Display wiki glossary responses, talk about how to improve them
3.  Quiz on basic math, chemical changes nomenclature
4.  ChemActivity 3 and 7, possibly 9, 10.


Atomic and Electronic Structure and the Periodic Table
=====================================

* ChemActivity 3 Atoms and the Periodic Table

Point: How to read the periodic table.  How to use it to make predictions.

* ChemActivity 7 Electron configuration and the Periodic Table

Point: More reading the periodic table, deducing valence from table
position, trivia about orbital shapes.  Emphasize that there are
different levels of description that are useful in different
circumstances.  Valence is enough in many cases.  In some, the shell
model is necessary, and in others, the full orbital picture is
necessary.


Chemical Bonding and the Ionic Bond Model
=========================================

* ChemActivity 9 Ions and Ionic Compounds  



* ChemActivity 10 Covalent and Ionic Bonds
