Homework Day 1
==============

 1 Read chapters 1, 2, and 3.  Write a summary of the main idea of each
 chapter.

 2 Prepare a glossary of at least 10 words, concepts, or ideas from
 each chapter.  Your glossary should contain the term, a short
 definition in *your own words*, and an example demonstrating the
 idea.  For example, your glossary entry for "physical change" might
 be:

    *physical change*: a process that changes some properties of a
     substance without changing the basic nature of the substance.
     For example, smashing a glass vase changes some properties of the
     vase (its shape), but does not change the underlying substance
     (the glass) into something new.

 3  Every other odd numbered problem in the Chapter 2 exercises (2.1,
 2.5, 2.9, ... up to 2.81, 2.85).  These problems will not be graded
 for correctness (the answers are in the back of the book anyway), but
 they will be checked for completion.  The point of this (lengthy)
 assignment, is to *practice* the mathematical operations we will be
 using over and over again throughout the course.  You should feel
 free to work with other classmates, but DO NOT split up the work --
 every student should be able to do every problem on their own, and
 the quiz we will take at the beginning of Day 2 will presume that you
 are personally prepared to do any of these problems by yourself.
