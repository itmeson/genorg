Topics: Introduction to the Course, Basic concepts about Matter, Measurements
=============================================================================

Introduction
--------------

This is going to be a very intense course.  We meet 4 times per week
for 3 hours per day.  The expectation is that you will be spending at
least 3-4 hours outside of class each day in reading, preparing
homework, studying, practicing, etc., and that you will be prepared
ahead of time for every class session.


In general, you should expect to see something like a quiz every class
session, and an exam once per week.  Class time will be split between
lecture, guided practice, formative assessment (activities that feel
like tests, but which are designed to help you learn while you show me
what you've already learned), self-reflection, and more.


My general approach to teaching is that it isn't about *me* -- it's
about you.  It's boring to watch someone else do chemistry, but it can
be very exciting to do chemistry yourself.  So most of our time will
be devoted to activities that force *you* to be doing something,
rather than watching me.  That said, a lot of organic chemistry
involves understanding and memorization of certain patterns of
reactions, certain properties of complex molecules, and how to give
*names* to them to make it easier for us to describe and use them.
Since a number of you are in the Nutrition program, the organic
portion of the course will be particularly useful for you in
understanding the chemical basis of many of the issues you consider
there.


But even more important than the practical application of organic
molecules in your other studies and in your careers is understanding
how a chemist/scientist *thinks*, how they approach understanding the
world, what kinds of questions they ask, how they deal with failure,
how they handle it when they don't have a clue what's going on --- so
that you can make use of some of those powerful tools yourself, in
situations where you will start with a feeling of hopelessness, but
still be able to figure out how to do it.


Basic Concepts About Matter --------------------------- 

solid, liquid, gas, physical vs. chemical properties, physical
vs. chemical changes, pure substance, mixture, heterogeneous mixtures,
homogeneous mixtures, elements, compounds.

How do we know about the elements?  How do we know if something is an
element or a compound?

Atoms, molecules, chemical formulas

 




Measurement
-----------

This is the algebra review and extension session.

Measurement and estimation activities.  How much stuff is in this
bottle?  How much of it would it take to fill the entire room?  How
many pennies to tile the floor?  and similar

Scientific notation, metric system

Density, conversion factors, rates of change

Temperature
