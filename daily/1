Topics: Introduction to the Course, Basic concepts about Matter, Measurements

Introduction:

This is going to be a very intense course.  We meet 4 times per week
for 3 hours per day.  The expectation is that you will be spending at
least 3-4 hours outside of class each day in reading, preparing
homework, studying, practicing, etc., and that you will be prepared
ahead of time for every class session.


In general, you should expect to see something like a quiz every class
session, and an exam once per week.  Class time will be split between lecture, guided practice
