Chemical Bonding: Covalent Bonds and Dot structures
==================================================
CA 9, 10

Point: You can use dot structures to represent ionic and covalent
bonds.  You can predict the compounds that can be formed between many
of the elements using the dot structures.

Get everybody caught up on 10.  For those that finish early, ask them to work on homework questions in Ch.6 and 7.
What is the difference between an ionic and a covalent bond?
How do you predict a bonding arrangement? 
 1. How big is the unfilled shell on each atom?
 2. How many electrons are actually in the unfilled shell?
 3. Can either atom give up/accept more?  Figure out the proportions that work.
 4. Check for blocking due to: electronegativity, geometry, inadequate shell model (when we're dealing with d-block metals)

Self-test: C_2 H_4,  C_3 H_6


Chemical calculations: Formula masses and equations
===================================================
CA 15  What is a mole?

 1.  Why is the mole concept important?  (Because there are too freaking many atoms to count)
 2.  How many moles of....?  How much does a mole weigh?

CA 16  Balancing chemical equations

 1.  Practice.  Give more from book.
