Chemical Bonding: Covalent Bonds and Dot structures
==================================================
CA 9, 10

Point: You can use dot structures to represent ionic and covalent
bonds.  You can predict the compounds that can be formed between many
of the elements using the dot structures.


Chemical calculations: Formula masses and equations
===================================================
CA 15  What is a mole?

CA 16  Balancing chemical equations
