Course Description

This course examines the chemistry of carbon-containing molecules
relevant to biological systems, such as the human body, beginning with
basic atomic structure, chemical bonding and reactions, and the
chemistry of acids, bases, buffers, and salts. Organic chemistry of
all functional groups are examined, including saturated/unsaturated
hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids, amines, and
alcohols. Emphasis is given to those compounds of biochemical
importance.


Course Objectives

From materials presented in class or in assigned readings, students
will be able to: 
1) Describe basic properties of matter consisting of
atoms and molecules.  
2) Give name and chemical symbols of elements
and to describe chemical formulas and reactions of carbon-based
molecules.  
3) Describe specific characteristics of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen and primary components of biomolecules and their
role in chemical reactivity and bonding.  
4) Define major organic reaction mechanisms such as oxidation-reduction,
 nucleophilic substitution, addition, elimination, isomerization, and 
hydrolysis.
5) Describe the chemistry of each functional group (carbonyl,
carboxyl, hydroxyl, amido, amino, esters, sulfhydryl) and the order of
their reactivities.

This is a one-month, summer-term intensive course in General and
Organic Chemistry that meets 4 days per week, 3 hours per day.
